### 1.FireDAO Positioning



### 2.How to join FireDAO

Joining FireDAO requires no permission and is automatically done by smart contracts. 

First, anyone can register a FireDAO Passport through the FireDAO Protocol registration contract to get a PID. Users with a PID become Associate Members of FireDAO who enjoy the basic rights to participate in the ecology. 

Second, FireDAO will spread fire seeds in the global Web3 crypto community. Any community member who owns a FireSeed fire seed can burn a fire seed, cast a FireSoul fire soul account, generate an FID, and become the official member of FireDAO: Full Member, which entitles full rights to participate in the ecology.
