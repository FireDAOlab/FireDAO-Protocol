## 1.FireDAO Positioning

FireDAO is a social DAO based on PID and FID soul-bound accounts initiated and established by the RainbowCity Foundation. It is a community-driven autonomous economy on the chain and a native Web3 based on blockchain technology DID identity protocol. On the basis of PID, FireDAO is centered on soul accounts and FID, combines with different types of soul-bound tokens, calculates the "on-chain reputation" score, and finally builds a set of native DID identity protocols on the Web3 chain.

As FireDAO develops to a certain stage, any native Web3 project can integrate into FireDAOâ€™s DID identity system, carry out various types of on-chain financial services based on On-chain Reputation, and carry out various types of soul airdrops for PID and FID owners, making FireDAO's identity system truly become the infrastructure of the whole Web3 world.

## 2.How to join FireDAO

Joining FireDAO requires no permission and is automatically done by smart contracts. 

First, anyone can register a FireDAO Passport through the FireDAO Protocol registration contract to get a PID. Users with a PID become Associate Members of FireDAO who enjoy the basic rights to participate in the ecology. 

Second, FireDAO will spread fire seeds in the global Web3 crypto community. Any community member who owns a FireSeed fire seed can burn a fire seed, cast a FireSoul fire soul account, generate an FID, and become the official member of FireDAO: Full Member, which entitles full rights to participate in the ecology.
